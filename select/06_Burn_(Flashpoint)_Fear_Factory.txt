I LIED... RIGHT TO YOUR FACE!...
ANd I'LL BURN... ETERNALLY!...
IN FLAMES(FLAMES)...IN FLAMES(FLAMES)...
IN FLAMES(FLAMES)...IN FLAMES(FLAMES)...

INSTINCT... HAS FAILED ME NOW...
ENSLAVED... BY MY DECEIT...

(Pre-chorus)
LIES SINK IN LIKE GASOLINE... SATURATES MY BODY...
ONE LAST SPARK OF DISHONESTY... AND THAT WILL BE... THE DEATH... OF ME!

(Chorus)
DAMNED... IN FLAMES!... DAMNED... IN FLAMES!...
DAMNED... IN FLAMES!... DAMNED... IN FLAMES!...

Lies engulf me... lies they burn... me...
Lies they purge... me... lies they free... me...

(Pre-chorus)

(Chorus)
